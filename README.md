Processor.v and processor_tb.v
--a Processor implementation that I began to dabble with using the diagrams and logic seen in the two .png's found in this repo


Things to consider:
--its overly complicated. The over complication was originally on purpose for my own learning outcome, but the complicated approach (specific control signal passing and focusing on a central control unit to communicate those signals) is not required for this assignment

--may not be truely single cycle, need to study the approach and make sure it could all pass for single cycle


AT THE END OF THE DAY:
None of this has to be used but we can use this current work as a learning tool to address how we would like to approach a new avenue.
